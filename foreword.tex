{\large Translator's Foreword}

This is a translation of Diederich Porath's {\it Palaestra Svecana}, a
rapier fencing manual published in 1693. It has been made into a
diploma edition (scans of the Swedish original text on the left,
English translation on the right), both to preserve the beauty of the
original work as well as making it easier to pair the (translated)
text to the original illustrations.

Invaluable help with editing the English translation from Olle Jonsson.

At any point where the original text is unclear, an attempt at
transcription will be present within [square brackets]. At any point
where the translator feels the need to leave a note, these will be
done as side-notes\sidenote{This would be an example side-note}
(primarily to preserve spatial closeness to the text the note pertains
to).  There may be cases where the text would be too long to fit in
the margin, in which case foot-notes will be used.

The scans used are from a PDF prepared by Kungliga
Biblioteket,\footnote{
http://www.kb.se/soka/kataloger/regina?func=find-b\&request=003701203\&find\_code=SYS\&local\_base=KBS01}
because these were the most legible scans that (so far) have been
found.

The primary translation sources during this work have been (in
approximately order of importance) Svenska Akademiens Ordbok (SAOB,
literally 'The Dictionary of the Swedish Academy'), a valuable source
of Swedish through history; Google Translate (for the occasional term
that is Italian) and the fact that late 17th century Swedish is
sufficiently close to now-Swedish that the main bar to comprehension
is the utter lack of consistency in spelling.
